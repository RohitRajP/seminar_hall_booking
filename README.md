# Seminar Hall Booking ‚úîÔ∏èüíªüî•

A **php** driven web app to facilitate and digitize the **seminar hall booking** process in **Saranathan College of Engineering, Tamil Nadu, India**.

The project started as my first ever officially useful software developed, and is now being used by almost **200-300 staff members** to book seminar halls across the Saranathan college campus.

The application is written in **PHP** since it was the easiest stack to learn along with **HTML and CSS and Bootstrap framework** to build a complete system with an interactive UI as well as a responsive backend.

This code is now legacy as the college IT staff have taken over the responsibility of maintaining and updating the system and have built in more features along the way
